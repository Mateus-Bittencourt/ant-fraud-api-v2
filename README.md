* **Rails version**: 7.1.3
* **SQLite version**: 1.4
* **Redis version**: 6.0.16
* **Sidekiq version**: 6.5.0

  bundle install
  yarn install
  ```

### Database Creation and Initialization
Run the following commands:

  rails s -p 3001
  ```
  ```bash

### ðŸ“š Using the API
Send a POST request with a payload like this:
  ```json
  {
    "transaction_id": 2342357,
    "merchant_id": 29744,
    "user_id": 97051,
    "card_number": "434505******9116",
    "transaction_date": "2019-11-31T23:16:32.812632",
    "transaction_amount": 373,
    "device_id": 285475
  }
  ```
To the endpoint:
  ```bash
  POST http://localhost:3001/transactions
  ```

Response:
  ```json
  {
    "transaction_id": 2342357,
    "recommendation": "approve"
  }
  ```

### ðŸ“š Register a Chargeback
Send a PATCH request with the transaction_id to the endpoint:
  ```bash
  PATCH http://localhost:3001/transactions/register_chargeback
  ```
Example payload:
  ```json
  {
    "transaction_id": 2342357
  }
  ```
## ðŸ“š Authentication
The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. When a user logs in, they receive a token that must be included in the Authorization header for subsequent requests.

### Login
To log in and receive a JWT token, send a POST request with the following payload:
  ```json
{
  "email": "mateusmbittencourt@gmail.com",
  "password": "1234"
}
  ```
Send the request to:
  ```bash
  POST http://localhost:3001/auth/login
  ```

Response:
  ```json
  {
    "token": "your_jwt_token_here"
  }
  ```

Include the received token in the Authorization header for protected endpoints:
Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token_here
